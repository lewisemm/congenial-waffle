    "# Introduction to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas** is a package for data manipulation and analysis in Python. The name Panda is derived from **Pan**el **Da**ta.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas incorporate two additional data structures into Python;\n",
    "* Pandas series\n",
    "* Pandas dataframe\n",
    "These data structures allow us to work with labelled and relational data in an easy and intuitive manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Pandas?\n",
    "The recent successes of machine learning algorithmsis partly due to the huge amounts of data that we have available to train our algorithms.\n",
    "However, when it comes to data, quantity is not the only thing that matters, the quality of data is just as important. It often happens that large datasets don't come ready to be fed into your learning algorithms. They will often have incorrect values, missing values, outliers etc.\n",
    "One important step in machine learning is to look at your data first and make sure it's well suited for your training algorithm by doing some basic data analysis.\n",
    "This is where Pandas come in.\n",
    "Pandas Series and Pandas Dataframes are designed for fast data analysis and manipulation. They are also flexible and easy to use.\n",
    "Below are some features that make it an excellent package for data analysis.\n",
    "* It allows the use of labels for rows and columns\n",
    "* Can calculate rolling statistics on time series data\n",
    "* Easy handling of NaN values\n",
    "* It's able to load data of different formats into DataFrames\n",
    "* Can join and merge different datasets together\n",
    "* Integrates with NumPy and Matplotlib"

    "## Creating a Panda series\n",
    "\n",
    "A Panda series is a one-dimensional array like object that can hold many datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One main difference between Panda Series and a NumPy ndarray is that you can assign an index label to each element in the Panda (you can name the indices in your Panda Series).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big difference between the two is that a Panda Series can contain elements of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a Pandas Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `pd.Series(data, index)` will create a Pandas series where `index` is the list of index labels.\n",
